## Mandatory startup
Before any technical change read in full:
1. `OCLP_PERMANENT_WORKING_RULES.md`;
2. this MASTER;
3. `OCLP_PERMANENT_VESA_RECOVERY_RULE.md`;
4. the exact checkpoint named above;
5. `OCLP_PROJECT_RETROSPECTIVE_20260827.md`;
6. `OCLP_HISTORY_INDEX.md`.

## Permanent contract
Target Tahoe `26.6.2 / 25G82`, Haswell HD4600/4400 family, SMBIOS `MacBookAir6,2`.
Local OCLP branch `alex-tahoe-25G82-custom`, expected HEAD `4143b7077a9a4e5aa41ec7a06c0888597eda9b06`.
Golden root-patched MTLCompiler SHA `ddabe975cd2ff3e8854d92a102aedfea6f1a3e586eccd50259639182b29ee269`, immutable/read-only.
True-five SHA `6e8969ee606b5e9321db2d4cf847a7ff6b32d46a9899b8eaa23e9c8f4f895c01`.

Protocol: identity-pinned FASTLANE -> complete audit -> manual Root Patch -> complete audit -> accelerated boot -> VESA recovery -> analyze only the selected accelerated boot -> persist. Never auto Root Patch or reboot. D50/D68/D82 reserve-only; D84 retired; Patch8 unauthorized.

Architecture: `Tahoe producer -> earliest non-equivalent handoff -> adapter/normalizer -> unchanged working donor path -> image`.

## Accepted functional lineage
P1 selector -> P2b request layout -> P3 serialized bitcode -> AIR00 AIR2.6/Metal3.1 -> D34 semantic-equivalent reset. P6/P7 retained with runtime sufficiency NEGATIVE.

## Durable D97 facts
D97AA proved runtime 32023 selection for an earlier cohort. D97AC statically mapped finite outcomes in `validSimulatorMetadata`. D97AD exact transition produced selector-only service SHA `a8716ffd75acab7ca2dd11b87861895f28fed386d098ad25280aba022f5b8b43` and final MTLCompiler SHA `524a16a716a4da8c26caf576dcf1fff7ed454e332cbfff81225578c934c8a755`.

Private D97AD build/deploy and manual Root Patch passed exactly. Selected accelerated boot is `2026-09-02 00:10`; VESA recovery `00:12` excluded.

D97AEQ verified exact visible D97AD bytes but found 28/28 service PIDs terminating normally with `exit(1)`, zero signals/missing and zero classifier exits 110-114. Runtime outcome classification is INVALID; natural exit1 is RUNTIME PROVEN 28/28.

D97AER proved the visible 32023 late simulator-limit xrefs lie after the visible D97AD candidate terminal REL+`0x58B`.

D97AES proved all 33 simulator diagnostics across all 28 PIDs were sent by MTLCompiler path `Versions/32023/MTLCompiler` with UUID `D5CE0008-587C-3861-971A-4BAEFB7B9C5B`; 3802 is NEGATIVE for the cohort.

D97AET found only historical sender/backtrace offsets `0x9FFEE` and `0xA5F81`, both outside the validator, so archived backtrace does not directly prove traversal beyond the visible terminal. It also proved the x86_64h Cryptex dyld shared cache contains the 32023 image path and not the 3802 path. Cache execution itself remains UNKNOWN.

Candidate byte discriminator at image offset `0x9D6BD`:
- P7/pre-D97AD `8b8d10feffff83f941`;
- D97AD `6a6e5fe9bb38f6ff90`.

## CURRENT ACTION — D97AEU
Use one read-only dyld shared-cache byte mapper. Locate cached MTLCompiler 32023 by path/UUID, translate image-relative offsets to cache-file offsets, and compare cached bytes at all six D97AD classifier sites against exact preimages/postimages, plus the shared stub and selected retained-patch sites. Refuse ambiguity. Cache presence alone is not runtime execution proof.

No Root Patch or reboot. D82 remains reserve-only; Patch8 unauthorized.
